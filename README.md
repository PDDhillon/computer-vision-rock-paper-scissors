# Milestone 2 
Teachable machine is a google application that allows you to create machine learning models, without having to write any code. I was able to utilise this application to create a machine learning model that will play the game rock paper scissors.

I trained this model on 900 images of me showing the three different states that are present in the game. The high amount of images meant that it would be more accurate at being able to detect the correct outcome. After completing, I exported the model and pushed the two susbsequent files to git. These files will now help to complete the implementation of rock paper scissors.
